**What is Move it ?**
This project is based on the Pomodoro technique, developed in 1988 by the Italian Francisco Cirillo, it's a method of time management that can be applied to different tasks, whether in studies or at work.
The Pomodoro method is simple and lasts two hours. First, you perform an activity for 25 minutes. When the time is up, rest for 5 minutes. So on until you complete two hours. As a reward, you rest another 30 minutes.
Learn more about Pomodoro: [PT-BR](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A9cnica_pomodoro) | [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

Pomodoro was applied in a gamification model, in which at each pause of tasks, there is a task at the moment of rest. After completing this task, the user gains experience, being able to level up.


**About Rocketseat Week**
This project was developed during the [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) week, it was designed to teach theory and practice about React JS and a little of its news.
After this week of programming, the study has to continue, so I decided to make improvements over this project, and made a roadmap of the improvements to be made, and others to be added to roadmap for the project.
The project is open to any type of collaboration, be it in the documentation, as in the development or ideas for the project.
The purpose of this repository is to show continuous study as a programmer, but also as a tool for anyone who wants to use it.
